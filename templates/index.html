<!--
    The difference between the percent sign and the double curly bracket notation that we've
used before, is that the double curly brackets contain an 'expression', which is outputting
something either onto the screen, or in this case, into our href.
The curly bracket and percentage are for statements that control the flow of our template, such
as a for-loop, if-statement, or this block element.
-->

<!--
    Essentially, when our index.html file loads, Flask inherits everything 
    from the base template. It then looks for a block element (which we called 'content')
    and injects that content
